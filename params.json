By asking a series of questions about the Django app, we can generate a generic deploy.yml file that can be consumed by any of the PaaS providers. Each PaaS provider can translate these requirements into a configuration that will work to deploy to their PaaS.\r\n\r\n### PaaS providers\r\n\r\nHere are instructions from each PaaS provider for how to deploy Django to their PaaS:\r\n\r\n* [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django)\r\n* [DotCloud](http://docs.dotcloud.com/0.4/tutorials/python/django/)\r\n* [Gondor.io](https://gondor.io/support/django/setup/)\r\n* [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/django-example)\r\n* [Stackato](http://docs.stackato.com/deploy/languages/python/django.html)\r\n* [Amazon Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/08/announcing-aws-elastic-beanstalk-support-for-python-and-seamless-database-integration.html)\r\n* [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/cloud-sql/django)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to django-deployer, here is how you can check it out. More complete instructions coming soon...\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/natea/django-deployer.git\r\n$ cd django-deployer\r\n$ ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was born at the DjangoCon 2012 sprint by @natea and @johnthedebs with input from Jacob Kaplan Moss (@jacobian), Andrew Godwin from ep.io, Gabriel and Ken Cochrane from @DotCloud, Kenneth Reitz from @Heroku and Diane Mueller from @ActiveState.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWe'd love to get input for how to best push this project forward. If you represent a PaaS provider and would like to contribute, submit a pull request or contact @natea with suggestions for making it better.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\nThis is not a new problem.
