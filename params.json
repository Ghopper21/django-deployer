{"name":"django-deployer","tagline":"Generic Deployment tool for Django that will support PaaS providers such as Heroku, Dotcloud, OpenShift, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure, Stackato and Gondor","body":"The goal of django-deployer is to minimize the effort to deploy a Django app to any of the popular PaaS providers. By asking a series of questions about the Django app, we can generate a generic deploy.yml file that can be consumed by any of the PaaS providers. Each PaaS provider can translate these requirements into a configuration that will work to deploy to their PaaS.\r\n\r\n### PaaS providers\r\n\r\nHere are instructions for how to deploy Django to various PaaS providers:\r\n\r\n* [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django)\r\n* [DotCloud](http://docs.dotcloud.com/tutorials/python/django/)\r\n* [Gondor.io](https://gondor.io/support/django/setup/)\r\n* [OpenShift](http://appsembler.com/blog/django-deployment-using-openshift/)\r\n* [Stackato](http://appsembler.com/blog/django-deployment-using-stackato/)\r\n* [Amazon Elastic Beanstalk](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_Python_django.html)\r\n* [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/cloud-sql/django)\r\n* [Microsoft Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/python/tutorials/web-app-with-django/)\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nInstall django-deployer in your virtualenv, and run the deployer-init command to copy the fabfile into your root folder. Then run the `fab setup` command to tell django-deployer about your project.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd <root_of_your_project>\r\n\r\n$ pip install django-deployer (this won't work until a release has been made to PyPi, so in the meantime, use the following)\r\n$ pip install https://github.com/natea/django-deployer/archive/master.zip\r\n$ deployer-init\r\n$ fab setup\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to django-deployer, here is how you can check it out and install it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/natea/django-deployer.git\r\n$ cd django-deployer\r\n$ python setup.py develop\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was born at the DjangoCon 2012 sprint by Nate Aune (@natea) and John Debs (@johnthedebs) with input from Jacob Kaplan Moss (@jacobian), Andrew Godwin (@andrewgodwin) from ep.io, Gabriel Grant (@gabrielgrant) and Ken Cochrane (@kencochrane) from @DotCloud, Kenneth Reitz (@kennethreitz) from @Heroku and Diane Mueller from @ActiveState.\r\n\r\nFurther work was done at the [PyCon 2013 sprint](https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/) by @natea and Colin Su (@littleq0903) to add support for Google App Engine. Kevin Grinberg (@kgrinberg), Kyle Kelley (@rgbkrk) also provided input.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWe'd love to get input for how to best push this project forward. If you represent a PaaS provider and would like to contribute, submit a pull request or contact @natea with suggestions for making it better.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\nThis is not a new problem. Here is a collection of other deployment tools that we found when researching this project:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/duointeractive/django-fabtastic\r\n* https://github.com/gcollazo/Fabulous\r\n* https://github.com/reverie/django-fabfile\r\n* https://github.com/tswicegood/django-on-vagrant\r\n* https://github.com/webengineer/django-fabfile\r\n* https://github.com/alexisbellido/The-Django-gunicorn-fabfile-project\r\n* https://github.com/akumria/django-paas\r\n* https://github.com/typeish/django-deploy\r\n* http://bits.btubbs.com/silk-deployment\r\n* https://github.com/winhamwr/neckbeard","google":"UA-18398802-10","note":"Don't delete this file!
